Command Handshake Synchronization Module
This module can be used for command communication between a bus and a slave module. A typical example is the transmission of the address and burst length from the AXI bus to the AXI interface slave device. (Of course, the burst length and address must be converted and aligned according to the byte count and other characteristics of the module in which this module is applied.)
